## Project: Stock Market Data

This project has the goal to put in practice my VBA skills. For this reason, I gathered a dataset from a stock market. And from this point, I developed three macros to iterate within all worksheets. Moreover, the results you can check below (Result header).

## Result
### Macro calculate_Vol_easy
`It will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock (Column J) had over that year.`
